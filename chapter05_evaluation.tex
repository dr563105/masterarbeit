\section{Testbed setup}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item dataset constant - Only dry day data?
        or everything?
    \item CNN parameters variable.
    \item epochs, learning rate, optimizer, loss function constant
    \item activation function constant or variable?
    \item for LSTM - timesteps value?
    \item graph - training, val loss vs epochs?
    \item graph - loss vs learning rate?
    \item graph - timesteps vs loss?
    \item graph - evaluation performance comparison?
    \item graph - Accel, brake, noaction predicted vs ?
    \item graph - brake, steering predicted vs ?
    \item graph - accel, brake, steering predicted vs ?
    \item graph - accel,brake, steering, distance(radar) predicted vs ?
    \item graph - with seg camera vs without?
    \item graph - with radar vs without?
    \item graph - imbalanced vs balanced Cross entropy?
