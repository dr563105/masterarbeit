\chapter{Conclusion}

In this thesis, an end-to-end neural network for autonomous driving with basic framework
is implemented. Upon evaluating, it is observed that light conditions play an important
role on how well the model predicts a correct decision. In the
\ref{chapter05subsec:setup1}, it is seen that afternoon time is favourable to get optimal output.
