Evaluation setup
-----------------------------
Dataset 1 - First one with just steering and no other training. 100k raw data with no traffic. With 1 centre camera.

Dataset 2 - 100k raw data with traffic and increased wait times at junctions. 

Dataset 3 - 270K raw data with normal waiting times, increased brake scenario, different weather and light conditions, also driving in different map. With segmentation and radar. 

----------------------------

Test scenario 1
----------------
Epsiodes - One minute. Manually start timer and run the evaluation. Count the # of collisions. If collided, reset episode and start again. If no collision, restart after episode duration(1 min).

Test Scenario 2
---------------
Loss function as constant and using dataset 3.

CNN architecture should be same!
MSE - output(accel, brake and steering all regression)
CCE - input images(center and center depth). Output(Accel, brake and steering mse)

With no traffic - 
Drive for 1 hour and see how model responds.
With traffic -
drive for 1 hout and see how model responds.

Epoch training - 50
