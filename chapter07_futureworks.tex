\chapter{Future Work}
One of the motivations of this thesis is to see whether it is possible to use LGSVL
simulator to implement an end-to-end network to predict control commands by using
supervised learning. The results prove that it is possible to achieve good results.
There are of course some challenges on the way such as the collected dataset could be more
balanced to allow different loss trainings. Then the next challenge is resources such as
storage memory, and processing power.
